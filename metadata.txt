description=Download CanVec, NTDB, DEM, Topo data for Canada
about=This plugin is a retrieval tool for downloading National Topographic System data for Canada from the NRCAN FTP site (ftp://ftp2.cits.rncan.gc.ca/pub/). The user selects which data sets they are interested in (DEM, vector base layers, georeferenced Topo map), which scale they want to download the data (1:50000 or 1:250000) and the NTS mapsheet name(s) (e.g. 092H12, 092I etc...), and the tool just pulls the data from the ftp site (which is organized by Mapsheet names), unzips and organizes the data.
